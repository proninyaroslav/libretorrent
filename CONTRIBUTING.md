If you want to contribute code, start by looking at the open issues on gitlab.com:

  https://gitlab.com/proninyaroslav/libretorrent/issues
  
Make sure to write your name and email id in format Name \<e-mail\> in the license declaration above every file you make change to.

Repeat and rinse, if you send enough patches to demonstrate you have a good coding skills, we'll just give you commit access on the real repo and you will be part of the development team.

Also, take a look at Coding Guidelines before making changes in code.

Coding Guidelines
---

 - Keep it simple, stupid. (KISS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
 - Do not repeat yourself. (DRY: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) Re-use your own code and our code.
 - If you want to help, the Issue tracker and TODO list is a good place to take a look at.
 - Try to follow our coding style and formatting before submitting a patch.
 - All pull requests should come from a feature branch created on your git fork. We'll review your code and will only merge it to the master branch if it doesn't break the build.
 - When you submit a pull request try to explain what issue you're fixing in detail and how you're fixing in detail it so it's easier for us to read your patches.
 - We prefer well named methods and code re-usability than a lot of comments.
