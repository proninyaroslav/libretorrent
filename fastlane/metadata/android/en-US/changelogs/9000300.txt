Migration to jlibtorrent 2.0 library was performed in test mode.
What doesn't work properly yet:
- Displaying tracker errors
- Displaying availability and relevance value
I ask those who decided to join the beta test to carefully test the app and report any bug fixes or the appearance of new errors.
